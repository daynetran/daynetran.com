title: Where am I from?
---

I am a Californian, through and through. 

I grew up in southern California, in a town a stone's throw from Disneyland and a stone's throw plus two hours of mind-numbing traffic from Los Angeles.  For college, I packed my things and moved all the way to ... Berkeley, in northern California! Again, I'm a Cali kid.

For the time being, I think I'm going to stay in the Bay Area. I love software and all things computers, and I feel that there is no better place to be for a computer geek than the Bay. Also, it may also be that my girlfriend is a Bay Area native, too...
