## Interests

I do spend much of my time thinking about and writing software. In a typical week, this translates
to approximately 60 hours, 10 hours a day for 6 days a week. John Carmack put it best: "You cannot
know everything, but you should convince yourself that you can know anything." I spend pretty much
every day, from sunrise to sunset, believing that I **can** know anything.
