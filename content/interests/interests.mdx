Although writing software is always on my mind, I do find myself with enough free time that I can pursue and enjoy other activities. Here are a few of them.

## Cooking

I love cooking and I love food. I can toil for hours, even for days, to combine ingredients, flavors, and scents into a singularly holy experience, and my God, it is so beautiful. Maybe the reason is that my main job involves staring at a screen and being in my own head all day, and this is a form of blissful escape. Regardless, it is a joy to make food, and there are few comforts in life better than a hearty meal I made for myself and my loved ones.

## Football at Foxborough and at Berkeley

My dad grew up a fan of the Patriots, and he must have made a vow the day I was born that he would instill the same fandom in me. I was lucky enough to grow up during the Patriots first three-Super-Bowl run, and so he bought the three documentaries for the three seasons, and he would play them for me over and over again.

I can vividly recall so many moments from those mini-movies. David Patton acrobatically catching a touchdown in the back of the end zone in the closing minutes of Super Bowl 35. Teddy Bruschi throwing precise, calculated haymakers at the football to cause a fumble. Adam Vinatieri nailing the game-winning field goal in the middle of a New England blizzard.

Anyone who knows a thing or two about the Patriots and the NFL knows that their success didn't end there. I got to be a fortunate Patriots fan all the way up to college, and soon after, when the pandemic started to wind down and I had two years left at Berkeley, I joined the staff at Cal Football as a student equipment manager.

Covid was a struggle and a fog for many of us, and I was no exception. But working at Cal Football and diving into the details of a sport that I grew up with and cherished truly rejuvenated me. I helped run practices, traveled with the team everywhere, and got paid to take the best seats in the house.

And so, today, I still love and follow football. During the season, you can always find me somewhere, either in the living room or at a sports bar, watching a football game.
